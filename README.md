# metro-sim
This was my first "real" project. Back then, I was learning computer programming by myself, so I didn't know anything about good code practices.

# Context
Back in 2016, I started by myself to learn computer programming and C++. At the end of the year, I started to learn 3D programming with the help of the library OpenGL.
As I was (and I am still) passionate by the Parisian metro, I built a metro driving simulator, that I wanted as realistic as possible. I coded a lot during my last year of high school ("Terminale") and my first year of university ("classe pr√©paratoire"), but I had to much work to do the following year to continue the project, that is now more of less dead -- even though the last code modifications were done in January 2022.

# Description
The application is a simulator: the point is to drive a metro train in a line, while making passengers enter and leave the train, respecting speed limitations and avoiding to collide with the other trains of the line.
The simulation is endless. When you reach the last station of the line, you can continue driving and you will get in the other direction of the same line. When you complete the second direction, you can continue driving and you will get back to the starting point.
