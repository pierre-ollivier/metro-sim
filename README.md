# metro-sim
This was my first "real" project. Back then, I was learning computer programming by myself, so I didn't know anything about good code practices.

# Context and description
Back in 2016, I started by myself to learn computer programming and C++. At the end of the year, I started to learn 3D programming with the help of the library OpenGL.
As I was (and I am still) passionate by the Parisian metro, I built a metro driving simulator, that I wanted as realistic as possible. I coded a lot during my last year of high school ("Terminale") and my first year of university ("classe pr√©paratoire"), but I had to much work to do the following year to continue the project, that is now more of less dead -- even though the last code modifications were done in January 2022.
